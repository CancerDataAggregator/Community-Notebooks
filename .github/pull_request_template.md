## The CDA Notebook Submission Process

Once you have submitted your PR, it will be automatically tested to ensure everything works as intended. 
Then it will undergo a short manual review to check that there is enough instruction/comments for a user to understand the work, weed out robots or spammers, and ensure there is no PHI or restricted data included. 
If your notebook requires any changes, we will describe the necessary changes in the PR review. 
When your notebook is approved we will merge your PR and add your notebook to the Library listing.
