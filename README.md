# Community-Notebooks

This public repository is a place to drop demonstration notebooks to share what you have done with CDA.

To add a notebook, add it to the main folder and make a pull request. Please tag @acharbonneau as a reviewer. Once your notebook has been tested and approved, it will be available for the scientific community both as a notebook in this repository and in the CDA Community Notebooks mybinder instance.

Note all notebooks should be visible for release or are finished product to be viewed by the general public.
