If you have comments, questions, or feature requests please tell us at our [Discussions page](https://github.com/CancerDataAggregator/readthedocs/discussions)

Building your notebook:

- On approval your notebook will be added to [this binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CancerDataAggregator/Community-Notebooks/HEAD?labpath=Welcome.ipynb), so if you can upload and run it in that environment, it should work.



Submitting a notebook:

- add it to the main folder and make a pull request
- If your notebook uses tools or modules that we do not have preloaded in that binder, please add them to this [requirements file](https://github.com/CancerDataAggregator/Community-Notebooks/blob/main/requirements.txt) as part of your pull request.
- Be sure to add your notebook information and a relative link to it under "Community Contributed Notebooks" to the [welcome page](https://github.com/CancerDataAggregator/Community-Notebooks/blob/main/Welcome.ipynb)
- Please be sure to fill out all fields of the pull request template. Failure to fill in these fields will result in a delay in approving your work.
- Our bots will run basic checks on your notebook, and build you a working preview site. Please check that your code runs as expected in the preview site.
- Watch your PR for bot notifications and change requests
- Once your notebook has been tested and approved, it will be available for the scientific community both as a notebook in this repository and in the CDA Community Notebooks binder.

Note all notebooks should be visible for release and be a finished product to be viewed by the general public.
