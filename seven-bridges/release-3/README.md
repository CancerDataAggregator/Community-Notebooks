**Importing files from CDA database into CGC projects**

This project contains a data studio analysis for querying and processing data from the CDA database and importing them to your CGC project(s). The analysis demonstrates usage of cda-python release 3 library, SBG python API and pandas in order to process and manipulate data available in the CDA.

Using the Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) and a harmonized data model developed by the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) Data Harmonization teams, users can discover, query, retrieve, and aggregate data according to a variety of search parameters, such as participant, sample, tissue, disease, or study.

More information about the CDA can be found in the [official documentation](https://cda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), while the latest cda-python package can be found on the [github page](https://github.com/CancerDataAggregator/cda-python).

**Copying the analysis to your project**

Once you log into [Seven Bridges Cancer Genomic Cloud](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/), you can copy the [Importing Data from CDA Release 3](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/u/sevenbridges/importing-data-from-cda-release-3) public project that will create a new project with all the code required to import data using CDA release 3.

Data studio analysis is available under the Data Studio tab in your project on [Seven Bridges Cancer Genomic Cloud](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/). In order to copy it to one of your projects, press the additional actions (three dots) button on the right side of the analysis page and then select the copy option. You should be able to chose any of the projects you are a part of and in which you have access.

As this analysis need to install required dependencies, hosted project must have the Network access project setting turned on. In order to manage project settings, select the Settings tab in the desired project and make sure that Network access is allowed.
